These dimensions are calculated starting with a baseline, then defined as a percentage of
that baseline.

Minor: Smaller dimensions often used for padding and margins between components inside a view.
The most common is 8dp, so that's the baseline used. Since 8dp is the baseline for minor,
then `minor_100` just means the dimension value is 100% of the baseline of 8dp.

Major: Larger dimensions often used for layout margins and padding. The most often used is 16dp,
so that's the baseline as defined in `major_100`.
