Better order status tools: manually change the status of an order – click the pencil icon next to the status – or add custom statuses. You can use custom statuses to filter, too.
Better multi-store tools: head to Settings and tap a store name to switch stores.
Rare bug crashes are even more rare – they’re gone – and lots of small tweaks make the app smoother overall.
