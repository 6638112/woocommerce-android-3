- Don’t have a Jetpack account? Now you can log in to your site while bypassing the Jetpack-required screen. (That said, you’re missing out on some powerful features — give Jetpack a try!)
- Some of you who do have a Jetpack-connected site would sometimes encounter issues while logging in. That’s a bug you’ll no longer run into.
- We fixed the way your My Store stats look before you receive your first order.
- A small group among you would occasionally deal with unexpected crashes; if that sounds like you, good news: you’ll no longer experience them.
