The tab formerly known as Notifications is now Reviews. As notifications are now shown under Orders, the Notifications tab was in need of a new identity. We have cunningly renamed it ‘Reviews,’ as it now just shows reviews.

The number of unfulfilled orders is gone from the dashboard and is now shown as a badge on the order list.

You will be prompted to perform updates within the app, so the hassle of having to open the Play store to do so is no more.
