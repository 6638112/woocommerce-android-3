You asked, and we listened! Now you can create simple, grouped, and external products directly from your favorite Android mobile devices. Turn ideas into products – even when you’re away from your desktop.
Other fixes: We fixed a bug affecting product variation names when the variation option was “open,” and a typo on the shipping label screen.
