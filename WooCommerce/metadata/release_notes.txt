- There’s a brand-new stats page (with more granular analytics) for those of you who use the WooCommerce Admin plugin! You can opt in to use it from the Settings page.
- Who doesn’t like a more streamlined experience? If you’ve disabled the stats module on your site, we’ll hide the visitor stats section on your My Store page.
- Enjoy a redesigned (and more readable) Customer Information and Payment sections in the order detail view.
