# This file is completely optional, but its usage makes it easier to work with libraries
# in local path. This example file needs to be copied as `included-builds.txt` to take
# effect.
#
# `settings.gradle` will call `includeBuild` on each relative path in this file.
#
# `includeBuild` call alone will not make a project a dependency of Woocommerce-Android.
# In order for a project to be a dependency, its module needs to be added in the
# `dependencies` section of the `build.gradle` file just like any other dependency.
#
# Android Studio will show each included project even if it's not added as a dependency.
# However, if an included build is not added as a dependency, it'll have no impact on
# the builds.
